            <p>If you're seeing this then you probably want to learn how to code, if not then you should probably check out the other tutorials I put out, but if you are, I'm gonna teach you a lot of codes.</p>
            <p> The first type of coding is HTML, and I'm gonna teach you about Doctype, </p>
            <h1> This is a main heading and the biggest &lt;h&gt; code, it is written as &lt;h1&gt;</h1>
            <h2> This is a level 2 heading, usually known as a subheading, it is written as &lt;h2&gt;</h2>
            <h3> This is a level 3 heading, anything that is a level three heading or under is used for things lower than a subheading, it is written as &lt;h3&gt;</h3>
            <h4> This is a level 4 heading, it is written as &lt;h4&gt;</h4>
            <h5> This is a level 5 heading, it is written as &lt;h5&gt;</h5>
            <h6> This is the smallest and last &lt;h&gt; code called the level 6 heading, it is written as &lt;h6&gt;</h5>
            <p> This is the paragraph element, a paragraph is used consistently with one or more sentences. People use the paragraph code because it is to understand when things are broken up into parts of text, it is written as &lt;p&gt;</p>
            <p> <b>This is  the bold element, it makes anything inside of this code turn bold, it is written as &lt;b&gt;</b></p>   </body>
            <p><i> This is the italics element, it is used to emphasize any words inside of this code with italics, its spelled as &lt;i&gt;</i></p>
            <p> This is the sup element, it makes a number smaller and raises it, this is known for mathematical things like raising a number by a power such as 2<sup>2</sup> or 7<sup>5</sup>, it is written as &lt;sup&gt;</p>
            <p> This is the sub-element, unlike the sup element, it can make numbers go down, it's use is known for chemical formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>0, it is written as &lt;sub&gt;</p>
            <p> This is a useful element called the br element, it makes a new line of sentences, for example,<br>this is<br>making sentences<br> easier to<br>read<br>it is written as &lt;br&gt;</p>
            <p> Now if you want to break a sentence with a line in between, you use the hr element, as an example,<br> Hi there, this website will help<hr> there are many things it will help with.</p>
            <p><strong> This is the strong element, it strongly emphasizes words and views it as in bold, it is written as &lt;strong&gt;</strong></p>
            <p><em> This is the em element, it subtly changes the meaning of a sentence, and it views any word in the element in italics, it is written as &lt;em&gt; </em></p>
            <p> There are 2 elements known with the use of adding quotes to an HTML website, one of them is a blockquote, which is used for long quotes, for example, <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book"> The book is an amazing source of knowledge it could rarely disapoint</p>
            <p> This is the quote element, it will make any words in the element become within quotation marks, for example, When Johnny left the house he forgot his wallet, but luckily his brother shouted<q> Wait you forgot your wallet!</q> So Johnny managed to get his wallet back.</p>
            <p> This is the abbr element, it abbreviates any word in between, When you hover your mouse over the word, it will show the full word, for example, The<abbr title=" professor"> Prof</abbr> Gave us our first-semester exam.</p>
            <p><cite> This is the cite element, it's used when you are referencing a book or movie or the name of something, you can use this element, it will render the content in this element in italics it is written as &lt;cite&gt;</cite></p>
            <p> This is the dfn element, it is used whenever it's the first time you type a word that you may need to define, some browsers show the content in the element in italics, but some do not change its appearance, for example, The <dfn>Big Bang</dfn> was a crazy phenomenon when it all started</p>
            <p> This is the address element, it's used to put in contact details, it can put in physical addresses, but it can also put in phone numbers or email addresses, for example, <address> <a href="mailto:example@gmail.com">example@gmail.com</a> intresting</address></p>
            <p> These are the ins and del elements, ins underline the content in the element, and del crosses of content in the element, for example, This is the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> day ever, it is written as &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;</p>
            <p> The s element has the same use as the del element, it crosses out words that have no more use or aren't supposed to be there, for example, I hate <s>cheese</s> coconuts. It is written as &lt;s&gt;</p>
            <p> The ol and li elements are for making lists, ol means ordered list and makes a list that has numbers for each column, and li means list item  which makes a row for each sentence you're saying in the list, for example, <ol><li>Cheese</li><li>Bread</li><li>Samon</li><li>Olive Oil</li></ol> they are written as &lt;li&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;</p>
            <p> The next list code is ul which stands for unordered list, and again you use the li code, for example, <ul><li>I like eggs</li><li>I like bacon</li><li>I like ham</li><li>I like bread</li></ul> </p>
            <p> The next list code is the dl code, which stands for definition code and the two codes you use are dt and dd. These two codes are useful for things like definitions of things, dt stands for definition term and is the word you your describing, while dd is used to contain the description, for example, <dl><dt>How To Make a Sandwhich</dt><dd>Flat Bread, Ham, Bottom Flat Bread</dd></dl>
<p> This is the image code, you can put a URL in it and the image will show up in a specific height and width depending on how you put it. <img src = "data:image/png;base64,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" width = "600" height = "450"></p>
